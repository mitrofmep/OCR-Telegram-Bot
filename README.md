# Telegram Image-to-Text Bot

This is a Telegram bot that can extract text from images and return it as a message. The bot is built with Spring Boot and uses the Tesseract-OCR library for optical character recognition.

# Features
- Image-to-text conversion: Simply send a picture to the bot, and it will try to extract the text from it and return it as a message.
- Language selection: The bot supports multiple languages, so users can specify the language of the source picture to get more accurate results.
- Easy deployment: The application is ready to be deployed to Heroku, so you can get your own instance of the bot up and running in no time.

# Stack
The bot is built with Java 11 and Spring Boot. It is based on the [TelegramBots library](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots), which provides a simple and flexible framework for building Telegram bots.

# Usage
To use the bot, simply add it to your Telegram contacts and start a conversation. You can send pictures to the bot, along with any text messages or commands that it supports.
